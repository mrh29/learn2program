## Programming in OCaml

This repository serves as a simple introduction to programming in OCaml.

## Overview of OCaml

OCaml is a statically typed, functional programming language.

## Strengths of OCaml

OCaml is cool because it can do foo.

## Weaknesses of Ocaml

OCaml is not cool because it cannot do bar.

## Running Programs in OCaml

To run your program in OCaml, do the following:

## Problem 1

Thie first problem is to modify a program by editing it
to include your name and age.
In the directory prob1, you should see a file named hello.ml.
It currently prints "Hello, world. My name is Alice, and I am 42."
Your first task is to edit the program, so that it prints
your name and age:
"Hello, world. My name is Y, and I am Z." To do this you need
to modify two things: the string "Alice" and the number 42. 

### Strings and Numbers
In programming, a string is a sequence of characters (or chars) that represent text to the
program. In X, they are started and ended with [character]. The other type
in this problem is a number or integer. This type represents a number which
can be used for a number of things from arithmetic to counters.

### More on Types
You may be wondering what the benefit of types are. Types allow programmers to
catch errors that could have derailed the program. Consider the basic example
2 + "Hello". Most languages will be able to detect a type error like this
and inform the programmer before having to run the program. When working
in a large codebase, typing can help you catch mistakes before
they've been run.


## Problem 2

The second problem is to modify a file to do Y.

## Problem 3

The third problem is to modify a file to do Y.

## Problem 4

The fourth problem is to modify a file to do Y.

## Problem 5

The final problem is to write a file from scratch that does Y

## Feedback

Please provide any feedback! I would love to hear what works and what does not.
