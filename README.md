# learn2program

## Intro

This repository serves as a simple introduction to programming. Recently I have had friends
talk about learning to program but not knowing where to start, so I thought I would try my
hand at a short introduction. I am in no way an expert on Computer Science education, but
I have worked with people learning how to code for the first time.

## Organization

This repo is organized into various branches. 

### Programming

X-todo and X-soln are branches with problems to solve in the language X. The initial languages will be
C, OCaml, and Python. C because it's widely used and important for understanding how computers
work at a lower level, Python because it's one of the easiest languages to get started with,
and OCaml to showcase a functional language.

### Git

The git-todo branch teaches basic profiency in git.

### Copmuter Science and Programming

This branch will feature more of an introduction to basic computer science topics
and how programming works.

## Getting Started

I would recommend getting started with the git-todo branch which will
help explain how to navigate and use this repository. To navigate to that
branch in a web browser, click the dropdown that currently reads main (below
the menu bar) and select the git-todo branch.

## Feedback

Please provide any feedback! I would love to hear what works and what does not.
