## Programming in Python

This repository serves as a simple introduction to programming in Python.

## Overview of Python

Python is a dynamically typed, imperative programming language.
Dynamically typed means that it occurs at runtime rather
than at compile time and that variable's type can change throughout the execution of the program.
Imperative means that you will write a sequence of steps (or instructions), that will accomplish what you want in your program. 
This is contrasted with a functional langauge where you write a sequence of functions that are executed to achieve some goal, and usually a function is a basic type.

## Strengths of Python

Python is very readable language. Most of the constructs are clear
and it is easy to understand what is happening by scanning the code. Part
of this is due to Python's enforced whitespace. In Python, a code block
must be indented to indicate that a new section is being started. This is 
contrasted with a language like C where whitespace is ignored. Additionally,
Python has many useful data structures built in to the language which makes
certain algorithms easy to implement.

## Weaknesses of Python

Python usually runs slower than a lower level language like C because
it handles a lot of things (e.g. memory management) for the programmer which requires overhead.

Additionally, dynamic types mean you may
run into type errors at run time (e.g. trying to perform 2 + 'Hello').


## Running Programs in Python

To run your program in Python, do the following:

Either run the program directly ```./program``` or call the python program to interpret
the program you wrote ```python3 program```.

## Problem 1

Thie first problem is to modify a program by editing it
to include your name and age.

## Problem 2

The second problem is to modify a file to validate a password. The goal is to validate that a password meets certain requirements (e.g. containing 5 numbers and 1 uppercase letter). You will also learn about unit testing.

## Problem 3

The third problem is to modify a file to do Y.

## Problem 4

The fourth problem is to modify a file to do Y.

## Problem 5

The final problem is to write a file from scratch that does Y

## Feedback

Please provide any feedback! I would love to hear what works and what does not.
